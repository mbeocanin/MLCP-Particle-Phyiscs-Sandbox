# MLCP Particle Phyiscs Sandbox
This is MATLAB implementation of a 2D particle physics simulation based on solving MLCP problem using Projected Gauss-Seidel method.<br />
It is based on a model designed by Erin Catto and presented in this article: https://box2d.org/files/ErinCatto_IterativeDynamics_GDC2005.pdf

# Running
Implementation was made and tested using MATLAB 2016a x64.<br />
To run:
1. choose src folder as MATLAB workspace directory
2. choose and run one example script at a time

GUI parameters are described through inline comments at the start of each of the example scripts.
